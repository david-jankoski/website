<p>Often I come across some websites that have free e-book deals each day or once in a while. Sometimes I’m lucky and it’s currently some title or topic I am interested in, but usually it’s some topic I have absolutely no clue about (“Learning Linux Binary Analysis”).<br />
However, you never know! Tomorrow or maybe in 18 days time there might be something on exactly the topic you are curious about!</p>
<p>Usually (at least for me) these websites end up in some dark corner in the bookmarks - maybe I would go back and check the deal for a couple of days in a row, but then I would slowly forget about it and every now and then remember to check back in on some free learning materials.<br />
So I thought to piece together a small scraper that would get the book deal of the day and push a desktop notification when i log in. That way I could stay informed and never miss the chance to obtain some nice material on a topic of interest.</p>
<div id="packt-learning-website" class="section level1">
<h1>Packt Learning Website</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt</a> is a website that offers learning materials on all kinds of IT related things - from general programming language textbooks to highly specialised titles. Each day there is a different book offered as a book-of-the-day deal for <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning">free</a>!<br />
In order to get the book one just needs to head over to their website and make a free account which entitles then the free download (availabe in a couple of different formats as well). I have used this opportuntity to get my hands on some books about 3D Printing, Git essentials as well as the obligatory Javascript data structures and algorithms :–).</p>
<p>Alright time to get the tools out…</p>

<h2>Scraping the book deal</h2>
<p>Inspecting the html of the page we notice that we are interested in the “<code>dotd-title</code>” and the “<code>dotd-main-book-image float-left</code>” <code>div</code>’s.<br />
<img src="/home/david-vogelstruis/projects/website/content/img/packt_html_snap.png" /></p>
<p>We’ll pull out the book title and the cover image.</p>

<div id="push-notification-to-desktop" class="section level2">
<h2>Push notification to desktop</h2>
<p>Gabor Csardi’s notifer package or alternatively using toast on win or notify-send on linux. Note that notifier is currently broken so resort to version 1.0.0</p>
</div>
<div id="schedule-script-on-logon" class="section level2">
<h2>Schedule script on logon</h2>
<p>Useful packages taskscheduleR and cron - however on win there is LOGON opt but cron on linux offers only datetime triggers (or i couldn’t figure it out). therefore scheduled it as a bash script.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-to-dos" class="section level2">
<h2>Future to do’s</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For the analysis part need to find a way how to automatically detect the keyword that stands for a certain language/technology from the book title. I’m sure there is somewhere out there a nice list of all possible languages and technologies under the sun that could be matched against.</p></li>
<li><p>A possible adaptation for the purpose of this scraper would be to just store some keywords that one is interested in like e.g. “machine learning”, “data structures c” and fuzzy-match against it in order to signal an offer tailored to one’s interests.</p></li>
