Hi there, my name is David and I come from Skopje, Macedonia. I spent some time in Darmstadt, Germany studying maths & computer science (and some more time drinking german beer :-)  

I got introduced to programming languages through Scheme, and later on Java (but never really made good friends with oop). I've always found functional programming constructs much more intuitive and, certain aspects of it quite fascinating (infinite data structures...woow).  
I am currently working as a data scientist for a young start-up company in Amsterdam where we try to predict the price movements of flight tickets. I would like to use the space here to write about things that I find interesting and useful, and hopefully someone else would find it helpful too.  
I am interested in all things, even remotely connected to R as well as functional programming, maths and modelling, web scraping and database architectures.  

### About This Site  

This site was made with the truly amazing package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) by the mysterious rmarkdown virus [Yihui Xie] :-) Make sure you head over to his [personal site](https://yihui.name/) and check out some of his kick-ass open-source projects!  
The theme was originally created by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/) and ported to Hugo by [Michael Romero](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo). Many thanks to everyone for their hard work and contributions to open source projects!  
All blog posts are compiled with knitr Rmarkdown, and I would try my best to provide reproducible sources of each blog post as well.
