Often I come across some websites that have free e-book deals each day or once in a while. Sometimes I'm lucky and it's currently some title or topic I am interested in, but usually it's some topic I have absolutely no clue about ("Learning Linux Binary Analysis").  
However, you never know! Tomorrow or maybe in 18 days time there might be something on exactly the topic you are curious about!

Usually (at least for me) these websites end up in some dark corner in the bookmarks - maybe I would go back and check the deal for a couple of days in a row, but then I would slowly forget about it and every now and then remember to check back in on some free learning materials.  
So I thought to piece together a small scraper that would get the book deal of the day and push a desktop notification when i log in. That way I could stay informed and never miss the chance to obtain some nice material on a topic of interest.  

# Packt Learning Website

[Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/) is a website that offers learning materials on all kinds of IT related things - from general programming language textbooks to highly specialised titles. Each day there is a different book offered as a book-of-the-day deal for [free](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)!  
In order to get the book one just needs to head over to their website and make a free account which entitles then the free download (availabe in a couple of different formats as well). I have used this opportuntity to get my hands on some books about 3D Printing, Git essentials as well as the obligatory Javascript data structures and algorithms :--).  

Alright time to get the tools out... 

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# httr & rvest scraping tools
library("httr")
library("rvest")
# for reading and writing images 
library("magick")
# for pushing a notification to the desktop
library("notifier")

# packt url for free learning deal of the day
packt <- "https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning"
```

## Scraping the book deal  

Inspecting the html of the page we notice that we are interested in the "`dotd-title`" and the "`dotd-main-book-image float-left`" `div`'s. This concrete example is simpler and it was easy to locate the items by right-clicking on them in the browser and then `Inspect Element`-ing them but for more complicated tasks I find [Selector Gadget](http://selectorgadget.com/) pretty awesome as it saves me lots of time.

We'll pull out the book title and the cover image.  

```{r read_site, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Scrape book deal of the day -----

# read in html
parse_site <-
  packt %>%
  httr::GET() %>%
  httr::content()

# extract the title of the deal of
# the day and remove any extra
# spacing and indentation around it
book_deal <-
  parse_site %>%
  rvest::html_nodes(".dotd-title") %>%
  rvest::html_text() %>%
  stringr::str_replace_all("\\n*\\t*", "")

# scrape the image for the book

# read in the img string
img_link <-
  parse_site %>%
  rvest::html_nodes(".dotd-main-book-image") %>%
  rvest::html_node("img") %>%
  rvest::html_attr("src") %>%
  stringr::str_replace_all(" ", "%20")

# pick a place where you want to store
# the book image
image_path <- "path of your choice.png"

# grab and store the image
img_link %>%
  paste0("http:", .) %>%
  magick::image_read() %>%
  magick::image_write(path = image_path)

```


## Push notification to desktop

In order to push a notification message to the desktop one could use a `system2` call to the underlying OS lib like toast for win or notify-send for linux, however there is a neat package from Gábor Csárdi called [notifier](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/notifier) that does all the work independent of platform. Just a small note that, at the time of writing, `notifier` was broken so [resort](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/notifier/issues/21) to version 1.0.0 from CRAN.  
Given the previous pieces of getting the book title and image went through alright, pushing a custom desktop notification now is simply calling  

```{r push_notif, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# push desktop notification
notifier::notify(
  title = "Packt book deal of the day",
  msg = book_deal,
  image = image_path)

```

This should already pop a notification on your screen with the title of the book as the body and a small image of the cover next to it.


## Schedule script on logon 


Last thing to do is to make this a task that would run on certain schedule or trigger. After some considerations I came to the conclusion that, for me, there was not one solid time period where I could definitely say I'm almost every day in front of the computer in order to use it for scheduling.  
Therefore it must be some other trigger than time. I figured a suitable moment would be for example 10 mins after I log in on my computer. I'm still opening programs or closing old tabs or generally still not focused on doing some thing, so it would be best to set up a user log-on trigger with certain time delay in order to fire up the scraper.  

I found that there are 2 packages that might come in handy here: [taskscheduleR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taskscheduleR/index.html) and [cronR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cronR/index.html). After some fiddling around I managed to get this working with `taskscheduleR` on windows. However if you want to schedule tasks, or in general make your system do certain things through R, make sure that you have the appropriate rights and that you start RStudio as an [admin](https://github.com/bnosac/taskscheduleR/issues/16)/sudo.  
This has come and bit me a couple of times (another time was when i was trying to start a docker deamon on a linux machine and it kept failing with status 125 until i figured that i need to do `sudo rstudio` in order for it to work).

cron does not quite have the same options as tasksch so had to resort to simple bash script on linux. 
Useful packages taskscheduleR and cron - however on win there is LOGON opt but cron on linux offers only datetime triggers (or i couldn't figure it out). therefore scheduled it as a bash script.

## Future to do's

- For the analysis part need to find a way how to automatically detect the keyword that stands for a certain language/technology from the book title. I'm sure there is somewhere out there a nice list of all possible languages and technologies under the sun that could be matched against.  

- A possible adaptation for the purpose of this scraper would be to just store some keywords that one is interested in like e.g. "machine learning", "data structures c" and fuzzy-match against it in order to signal an offer tailored to one's interests.
